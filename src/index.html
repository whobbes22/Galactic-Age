  <p>hi</p>
  <p>The Earth orbits the sun approximately once every 365 days. 365 days is equal to one year.</p>
  <p>The other planets in our solar system orbit the sun at varying speeds. It is usually the case that the closer you are to the sun the less time it will take to go around the sun. This means that a year which is the time for a planet to orbit the sun is different on each planet. Venus is a planet that is closer then the Earth so it takes a shorter time to orbit the sun. Mars is a planet further away from the sun so it takes a longer time to orbit the sun.</p>
